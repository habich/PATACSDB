	<h4>What is polyA translational attenuator?</h4>
	polyA translational attenuator is a segment encoding large number of consecutive adenines (our results suggests pattern 12A allowing for one mismatch in between) in coding sequences. 
This mRNA motif impacts gene expression differently from previously described effects of polybasic amino acid runs adding a new layer of complexity to regulation of gene expression at the level of translation. In our experimental work we showed that runs of adenosine nucleotides that usually encode lysine residues may act as translational attenuators in human genes altering the amount of protein output, the stability of the mRNA, or leading to production of “alternative” frame-shifted products. These sequences induce ribosome pausing in various eukaryotic cells arguing that this mechanism is conserved and may be used to regulate gene expression across diverse biological systems.

	<h4>Using the database</h4>

	<p>1. Select the species from the main page of the database. You have the search box at the top of the table, on the right. For each species we list the total number of proteins, total number of transcripts (can be larger, depends on the number of isoforms) and number of transcripts with at least one polyA segment.</p>

	<p>2. Upon selecting the species, you will be presented with the table containing all polyA segments, one by one. The table contains grotein names, gene ids and transcript ids as reported by Ensembl database. Location column reports in which part of the transcript the polyA segment is located, percentage wise (0% means the start, while 90% means close to the end). The last column is a polyA sequence found with the nearest surrounding. [START] and [STOP] denote beginning and end of a transcript, respectively. Links in the table point to Ensembl views for gene, transcript and that particular polyA sequence. All columns are searchable and sortable. Changing order in "sequence" column will sort the sequences from the shortest polyA segment to the longest or vice versa.</p>
